# Prints a hash of every source file the quality gate cares about, in its
# current working-tree state.
#
# scripts/verify.sh records this hash after a successful run, and the Stop hook
# in .claude/settings.json compares against it: an identical hash means the
# tree hasn't changed since the gate last passed, so there is nothing to
# re-verify. Build outputs, coverage reports and other ignored paths are left
# out, since they change on every run and would invalidate the stamp
# immediately.

# Usage: scripts/workspace_hash.sh

# are deliberately absent, so editing a README never asks for a test run.
